# 1.9: Publish

As I have reached a stable point in previous step, I create a git
repository **stm32bringup**, publish it on
[github.com](https://github.com/rfivet/stm32bringup) with a mirror on
[git.sdf.org](https://git.sdf.org/rfivet/stm32bringup).

I chose MIT license as open source license for the code.

The only rework of the C sources is the addition of a copyright notice
and conversion of tabs to spaces for portability.

[Next]( index#part2) I will start working with USART peripherals: select
an USB adapter, flash the board over the UART communication and say
hello to the world.
